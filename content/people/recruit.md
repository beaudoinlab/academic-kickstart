The Beaudoin lab is currently building its team! The lab will open in January 2020 and it is your chance to become an active and important member of this new exciting team. We aim to build a diverse and collaborative team where each individual brings something different and has room to grow scientifically and professionally. If you want to share your passion for science with Jean-Denis and the rest of the team, you are more than welcome to apply for a position in our group. We are particularly looking to recruit a research technician, multiple postdocs, and graduate students. Funding for [our open positions](#open-positions) is available from our start-up and NIH Pathway to Independence (K99/R00) award.
