Hi! I am Jean-Denis, a French Canadian who came to the US to complete his Post-doctoral studies at Yale University and who is now joining the UCONN Health team as an Assistant Professor! Here is a little bit about myself. Curiously, I fit most Canadian stereotypes out there. I don’t qualify winter in Connecticut as real winter. I need to play hockey to stay mentally sane. I provide maple syrup to people from the department in the Spring and I love lumberjacking with my grandfather in the Fall. You will see me wearing Montreal Canadiens gears on important game days, but I much prefer American football over Canadian football. When I am not in the lab, I enjoy passing quality time with my family. I have a young son and watching him grow is simply sublime. I am a big craft beer amateur and will venture to new breweries all over the northeast on weekends. I stay connected with the outdoors by hiking, skiing, ice skating, snowshoeing, rollerblading, fishing and more. In short, I practice a good balance between personal and professional life.

Professionally, I am a very enthusiastic person. I love to share my passion for science with others and discuss about new ideas, experiments, results, recent publications, meetings and more. I completed my B.Sc. in Biotechnology at Université de Sherbrooke (Québec, Canada) and my Ph.D. in Biochemistry in the laboratory of Jean-Pierre Perreault at Université de Sherbrooke (Québec Canada). During my graduate studies, I addressed how do RNA structures control RNA activity? My work discovered novel properties and functions of RNA G-quadruplexes, a structure formed by G-rich sequences. First, I characterized their folding properties and dynamics in vitro ([Beaudoin JD, *et al.* 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18456841); Beaudoin JD, *et al.* 2013. Next, I developed an algorithm to locate genomic sequences susceptible to form G-quaruplexes ([Beaudoin JD,  *et al.* 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121682))) and found that, in human cell cultures, 5’-UTR G-quadruplexes act as key translational repressors ([Beaudoin JD and Perreault JP, 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20571090)) and 3’-UTR G-quadruplexes can modulate alternative polyadenylation leading to differential expression (Beaudoin JD. and Perreault JP., Nucleic Acids Res. 2013). Together, this work provided mechanistic insights into a previously unrecognized role for RNA G-quadruplexes in gene expression regulation. Following from this work, we developed an oligonucleotide-based approach to target individual RNA G-quadruplexes and tune gene expression in a desired direction ([Rouleau SG, Beaudoin JD, *et al.* 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25510493)). These findings highlighted the potential to target RNA regulatory elements to control gene expression, opening promising novel therapeutic strategies.

In 2013, I started my postdoc in the laboratory of Antonio Giraldez at Yale University. For my postdoctoral work, I extended my expertise in molecular, cellular and RNA biology to study a fundamental process in all animals, the maternal-to-zygotic transition, where post-transcriptional regulation orchestrates a profound change in the embryonic transcriptional landscape. Here, I asked two central questions: what are the RNA structures formed during early embryogenesis and how do they interact with cellular factors to control gene expression during development? To address these questions, I developed innovative genome-wide in vivo RNA probing techniques to gain structural information on the zebrafish transcriptome during embryogenesis. I also expanded my technical repertoire to perform high throughput approaches to measure genome-wide gene expression in vivo, including mRNA abundance (RNA-seq) and translation (Ribo-seq). By integrating this information, I generated a global interaction map between RNA structure, mRNA stability and translation during early embryogenesis ([Beaudoin JD\*, Novoa EM\* *et al.* 2018.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061596)). Our results provide three major insights: (1) Contrary to the current dogma, we found that untranslated mRNAs are more structured in vivo compared to in vitro, (2) globally, translation guides mRNA structures rather than structure guiding translation ([Karmer MC and Gregory BD, 2018.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061597)), and (3) RNA structures remodeled in 3’-UTRs are enriched for regulatory activity during development.

Now, I am extremely excited to start my lab at UCONN Health in the Department of Genetics and Genome Sciences and can’t wait to see what the future holds!
