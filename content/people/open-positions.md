## Postdoctoral researchers
Postdoc positions are available for experienced scientists in RNA biology, Biochemistry, Cellular Biology, Computational Biology or Developmental Biology. Our lab is seeking both
**molecular biologists** and **computational biologists**.

For **molecular biologists**, we seek experimental experience in one or more of these skills:

*	RNA probing/structure  
*	Zebrafish system (e.g. development, microinjection, genetics, genome engineering techniques)  
*	Microscopy techniques (confocal, high resolution, etc.)  
*	Cell culture techniques (transfection, gene expression analysis, stem cell differentiation, etc.)  
*	Translation regulation  
*	High throughput approaches and sequencing (e.g. RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, massive parallel reporter assay, RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions)  
*	Liquid-liquid phase separation and/or intrinsically disordered proteins  

For **computational biologists**, we seek computational experience in one or more of these skills:

* Analysis of high throughput sequencing data (e.g. nanopore, RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, massive parallel reporter assay, RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions)  
* Proficient script writing (ideally in Python or R)  
* Statistical analysis  
* RNA structure prediction  
* Machine learning (e.g. Neural networks, random forests, etc.)  

The ideal candidates would have a mixture of both experimental and computational experience. To apply please send a Cover Letter describing past research accomplishments and future research interests and career goal, your CV, and a list of three references in an [email to Jean-Denis](mailto:jdbeaudoin@uchc.edu).

## Graduate students

UConn Graduate students in the [Biomedical Science PhD Program](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/) are encourage to rotate in the lab. If you are an admitted graduate student with an interest to learn about RNA biology, genetics, computational biology, genomics or developmental biology in a collaborative and stimulating environment, you should [email Jean-Denis](mailto:jdbeaudoin@uchc.edu) as early as possible about rotation opportunities and possible projects.

Undergraduates who are looking to pursue a PhD must first apply to the [PhD In Biomedical Science](https://health.uconn.edu/graduate-school/academics/programs/ph-d-biomedical-science/).

## Research technician

We are looking for someone independent and creative to maintain the fish facility, order lab supplies, and help out with various projects around the lab. This position includes the opportunity for independent projects for candidates pursuing a research career. Candidates should have (or be pursuing) a bachelors degree in Biology or a related field.

Past experience in fish husbandry or in a research lab is excellent, but if you are eager to learn, proactive and interested in the kind of things we do, you are more than welcome to apply. Please [email Jean-Denis](mailto:jdbeaudoin@uchc.edu) with a Cover Letter, your CV, and a list of three references.
