**Research in the Beaudoin lab** stems from two captivating biological observations that appear unrelated at first sight. The first is the fascinating process by which two of the most specialized and highly differentiated animal cells, the sperm and the oocyte, come together and transition to a completely na√Øve state from which they differentiate to form all the different cell types and tissues required to create a brand-new animal. This a fundamental process of embryonic development is universal across the animal kingdom.

At a whole different scale, at the level of molecules, we find that transcripts of RNA coordinate the flow of information circulating within a cell. The central role of RNA in biology is enabled by a broad diversity of RNA functions. RNA acts as a template for the construction of proteins. RNA operates as a platform to bind various factors to regulate gene expression. RNA also constitutes the backbone of some of the most important machineries found within the cell, such as the ribosome, the telomerase enzyme, the RNAse P, tRNA, the splicosome, and many others. Consider now that RNA is a polymer of four simple monomers; it is striking how such complex functions can arise from simple rearrangements of four base components. One thing is often forgotten, though. It is impossible to dissociate RNA function from RNA structure. RNA structure provides a fundamental regulatory layer of RNA activities.

In the Beaudoin lab, we are inspired by these two phenomena of dynamic cellular transitions during development and the role of RNA structure in governing the flow of cellular information. We aim to characterize RNA structure and functions to better understand vertebrate development. To this end, our lab uses the zebrafish and human cell lines as model systems, and we integrate an array of approaches that includes RNA molecular biology, computational biology, high throughput sequencing, genome-engineering, genetics, and developmental biology.
