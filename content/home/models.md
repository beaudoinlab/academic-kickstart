The Beaudoin lab is fascinated by the biological process of two highly specialized cells, the sperm and the oocyte, coming together and transitioning to a fully-grown organism. Although we know many transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, and enhancer sequences that orchestrate these cellular transitions, we know comparatively little about RNA structure governs gene regulation and expression during development.


To characterize the regulatory role of RNA structures during vertebrate development, our lab uses two model systems. First and foremost, we the zebrafish as a vertebrate system that provides numerous advantages. The zebrafish shares 70% of its genes with human, and 85% of human genes involved in diseases have a zebrafish homologue. The zebrafish is an *in vivo* system with robust genome engineering, mutagenesis and large progeny facilitating genetic studies. The zebrafish embryo is transparent making it ideal for microscopy techniques, and it grows at an extremely fast rate with most major tissues forming within the first 24 hour post-fertilization. Unlike in mammals, the fish embryo develops outside the motherâ€™s body making it amenable to biochemical approaches. Our group has developed rapid massive parallel reporter assays to survey molecular functions of RNA across the genome with unprecedented complexity ([Beaudoin et al. 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30061596)). We also know that post-transcriptional regulation tightly orchestrates the first steps of embryogenesis during a process called the maternal-to-zygotic transition. No wonder why we love our fish!

To complement the powerful zebrafish model, we will also leverage human stem cell lines to uncover and characterize conserved gene regulatory pathways important for human development and health. Here, our goal is to study the regulatory role of RNA structures in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells during various differentiation pathways (e.g. neuronal differentiation). Much of this research will be facilitated by the genome editing and reprogramming resources at the [UConn Stem Cell Core Facility](https://health.uconn.edu/stem-cell-core/).
